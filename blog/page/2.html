<img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/stage-4-367f329abb10ff4d1f0e1eede7a9c0d6.jpg" width="1041" height="773" class="img_ev3q"></p><h1>Gifford Circus Cyr Wheel Performances - A Custom Modular Circular Stage</h1><p>We were commissioned to design and construct a circular stage for a Cyr wheel performance in Gifford&#x27;s Circus. The stage had to meet several requirements: it had to have a diameter of 6 meters, be able to be disassembled into pieces small enough to fit through a door with a width of 2.6 meters, be able to support the weight of performers, be easy to assemble by two people in a short amount of time (with each panel weighing no more than 50kg), be flat and level on rough ground, and be durable enough to withstand the rough handling and moisture of circus life.</p><p>To achieve these goals, we considered various designs for the circle and ultimately settled on a composite panel made of an XPS core sandwiched between two layers of extra durable fibreglass, with a non-slip coating. The material was cut into the necessary shapes using a hot wire cutter with a rectangular profile, and the foam was removed from the mating edges, leaving only the outer fibreglass material. Adhesive was applied and aluminum extrusion was pressed into the edges of the panels. The aluminum provided protection for the edges, supported the edges to prevent deflection, and provided slots for the removable leg structures that connected the panels together.</p><p>The leg structures were placed at the intersection of three panels and consisted of three pieces of steel box section fitted within aluminum U channels and welded at 120-degree increments to form a three-directional cross. A hole was left at the intersection, into which a threaded tube was welded. An internal hex bolt or long grub screw with a foot plate on the bottom was threaded into the tube and could be adjusted from above through a small hole in the stage using an allen key bit on an impact driver. This arrangement allowed for a quick and easy assembly process, with the legs being extended until they touched the ground to level the stage. The pieces were held together with inner steel box sections curved on the outer curved edges, and a large ratchet strap was used to wrap around the entire structure and compress the circle inward, pulling all the pieces together.</p><p>Overall, the design and construction of the circular stage was a challenging but rewarding project. We were able to meet all of the requirements set forth by the client and create a stage that was durable, stable, and easy to assemble and transport. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/stage-7-536a8dc3915c3bc552fc3a732e057602.jpg" width="1041" height="773" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/stage-8-27308a0483995332cca67e02fbdec9fc.jpg" width="1058" height="752" class="img_ev3q">

With 3km of arenas and fields to cover, the deployment of the network was a massive and complex undertaking. To ensure that the site was properly connected, network cabinets were set up in each arena and connected with miles of fiber optic cable. These cabinets were then connected to multiple ADSL connections that were bonded together, providing a robust and reliable internet connection.</p><p>To provide connectivity within each arena, smaller network switches were located within 100m of the cabinets. Locations that were beyond this range were connected with wireless point-to-point links, which were either mounted on poles attached to the sides of tents or beam out across the arena from wireless sectors mounted on cherry pickers. These signals were then picked up at distant locations through wireless point-to-point receivers attached to the sides of tents.</p><p>In addition to the network infrastructure, the event also required a comprehensive CCTV system to ensure the safety of attendees. To this end, at least one cherry picker equipped with a pan-tilt-zoom CCTV camera was stationed within each arena, with additional cameras installed on scaffolding poles, gateway arches, and stage sides. WiFi was also provided in the crew and camping areas, and temporary offices were equipped with temporary WiFi and VoIP phones for both internal and external communication.</p><p>To aid in the deployment and management of the network, we utilized a number of tools and resources. For example, we used QGIS&#x27;s &#x27;Align Raster&#x27; tool to georeference a high-definition image of the site map, which we then uploaded to Mapbox and used to create a basic Leaflet.js web map. This map used the host phone&#x27;s geolocation to position a marker, helping us to determine our exact location on the site and identify which tents required connectivity. We also used the &#x27;Map Marker&#x27; app on Android to quickly locate network devices as we deployed them.</p><p>After the event, the map was used to quickly locate and retrieve all of the equipment. This was particularly useful as the staff members who investigate faults or retrieve hardware after an event are often different from those who deployed it, making it difficult to locate the devices without a detailed and up-to-date map showing their locations and connections. By using this map, we were able to efficiently trace faults in the network and ensure that all of the equipment was properly accounted for. Overall, the deployment and management of the network at the Isle of Wight Festival was a successful and complex endeavor that helped to ensure the smooth operation of the event.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/hello">hello</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/docusaurus">docusaurus</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/live-network-map-for-womad-festival">Live Network Map for WOMAD Festival - Visualizing Status and Coverage</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2019-05-10T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 10, 2019</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://reubenliengaard.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Reuben Liengaard</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Maintainer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The web application we developed allows users to access and update the location data for network devices. When the location of a device needs to be recorded, the user simply enters the device&#x27;s MAC address into the app. The MAC address is then checked against a list of available device MAC addresses in the database to verify its authenticity. If the MAC address exists in the database, it is marked as &quot;deployed&quot; and the coordinates of the user&#x27;s phone, on which the update was made, are added to the latitude and longitude columns. If the MAC address is entered incorrectly or does not correspond to a device in the database, the app user is notified and asked to enter a different MAC address.</p><p>The deployed devices are displayed on a map in real-time, allowing users to easily view and locate them. Each device can be clicked on to view information such as its device type, MAC address, IP address, and more. Users also have the option to select a device for deletion, which changes the corresponding value in the &quot;deployment status&quot; column to &quot;false&quot; and removes the latitude and longitude position values from the database.</p><p>To aid in testing and debugging the app, we also developed a BASH script that produces fake data for testing purposes. This script generates a CSV file containing random MAC addresses, asset tags, device models, and locations, which can then be uploaded to the database for testing purposes. By using this script, we were able to simulate different scenarios and ensure that the app was functioning correctly before deploying it in a live environment.</p><div class="language-bash

This column likely contains an array of descriptive tags or categories for each topographic area.</p><p>The results of this query can inform planning and conservation efforts by identifying areas that are potentially well-suited for rewilding. These areas could provide corridors for wildlife movement through urban environments and enhance biodiversity in these areas.

We wanted to capture the mood and atmosphere of the natural environments where these materials are typically found, such as the underground world of stone and water or the airy heights of wood.</p><p>To this end, we experimented with lightweight hazel structures as a way to combine wood and air in our design. We were particularly interested in the underground world of stone and water, and decided to dig a tunnel into the side of a hill to see what we could discover. Unfortunately, the largest cavity we found was only two feet wide, and we had to come up with a different solution to support the roof of the tunnel. We ended up building concrete block load-bearing walls with concrete lintels supporting the stone above, which took up a lot of space and lost some of the rustic charm of our original design, but was necessary for safety.</p><p>According to our cross-sectional diagram, there is a third layer between the stone and wood in our design - a thin layer of mud from which all life springs. While we have not yet conducted extensive research on using mud as a building material, we have done extensive research and design work on the organic life that it can support. In our design, we envision the wood as the ideal location for sleeping quarters, warm and dry in the loft, while the ground floor would be reserved for the kitchen, toilet, and other organic activities, including food production. There may also be some kind of underground stone cavernous space beneath the building for an as-yet-unknown purpose.</p><p>Overall, our goal in this project was to use natural building materials in unique and innovative ways that captured the mood and atmosphere of the natural environments where these materials are typically found. While we encountered some challenges along the way, the process was exciting and rewarding, and we are proud of the design we have created.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/hola">hola</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/docusaurus">docusaurus</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/flood-risk-assessment-of-pudding-brook">Flood Risk Assessment of Pudding Brooke</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2017-03-05T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">March 5, 2017</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://reubenliengaard.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Reuben Liengaard</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Maintainer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In order to assess the flood risk of Pudding Brooke, we first imported Digital Terrain Model LIDAR tiles into QGIS and used them to create contour polygons at 0.25m intervals.

This allowed us to easily visualize the topography of the area and identify areas that were prone to flooding.</p><p>After creating the contour polygons, we selected potential sites for outbuildings in appropriate high ground locations. This was an important step in the flood risk assessment process, as we needed to ensure that any new structures that were built would be situated on high ground and therefore less vulnerable to flooding.

We propose planting seedlings in a steel cable reinforced fiber matting that hangs vertically above the counter. This matting would be supported by two large drums at the top and bottom, and would be able to rotate at a speed calculated based on the height of the assembly, the maturation time of the chosen crop, and the desired harvesting frequency. This way, a seedling planted at the bottom would be ready for harvest by the time it reaches the top and returns to the bottom. With this system, the salad bar would be able to achieve perpetual harvesting, meeting its demand for fresh produce without having to rely on traditional terrestrial agriculture methods.</p><p>In addition to this innovative planting system, we also propose supplying the plants with dissolved nutrients by producing an ultrasonic fog in the chamber between the two planting surfaces. This would help to ensure that the plants have all the nutrients they need to grow and thrive. To maintain a stable temperature for the plants, we suggest using a vertical poly tunnel in colder climates to protect them from temperature fluctuations.</p><p>Overall, our self-sustaining salad bar concept would be a revolutionary way to meet the demand for fresh produce in a sustainable and efficient manner. By utilizing vertical space and innovative technologies, we believe this concept has the potential to revolutionize the way that salad bars and other food establishments source their produce.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/hola">hola</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/docusaurus">docusaurus</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/designing-a-living-building:-an-organism-with-a-symbiotic-relationship-with-its-occupants">Designing a Living Building - An Organism with a Symbiotic Relationship with Its Occupants</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2017-03-05T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">March 5, 2017</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://reubenliengaard.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Reuben Liengaard</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Maintainer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>When designing a building, it is important to consider the building as an organism that has a symbiotic relationship with its occupants. This means that the building should be organized like a system of interdependent organisms, with each organism fulfilling a specific function within the larger structure. By treating the building as an organism, we can create a dynamic and self-sustaining ecosystem that supports the health and well-being of its occupants.</p><p>There are many different types of organisms that can be incorporated into the design of a building. Some examples might include microalgae, which can be used for wastewater treatment and oxygen production; vermiculture, which can be used for composting and soil improvement; fish, which can be used for food production and waste management; guinea pigs, which can be used for research and education; leafy green plants, which can be used for air purification and aesthetics; and bacteria, which can be used for biological processes such as fermentation and nutrient cycling.</p><p>The building itself should function like a shell or frame that provides a home for these organisms. By using environment-specific creatures, it is possible to keep different systems separate, creating an urban jungle inside the building. This approach allows for the creation of a diverse and self-sustaining ecosystem within the building, providing numerous benefits to the occupants such as improved air quality, food production, and waste management. By considering the building as an organism with a symbiotic relationship with its occupants, we can design buildings that are more dynamic, self-sustaining, and supportive of human health and well-being.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/hola">hola</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/docusaurus">docusaurus</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/intro">Work</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reubenliengaard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Stack Overflow<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/reubenliengaard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 My Project, Inc.
