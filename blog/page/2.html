A Custom Modular Circular Stage</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-02-02T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">February 2, 2021</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://reubenliengaard.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Reuben Liengaard</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Maintainer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>We were asked to design and build a circular stage for a Cyr wheel performance in Gifford&#x27;s Circus. The stage had to have a diameter of 6 meters and be able to be broken down into pieces small enough to fit through the 2.6 meter wide door of the circus tent. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/stage-3-f13d41dad830cad645c00222c4afabd5.jpg" width="1018" height="1064" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It also had to be sturdy enough to support the weight of the performers, but light enough to be easily assembled by two people in a few minutes, meaning each panel could weigh no more than 50kg. The stage had to be flat and level, despite being sited on rough ground, so we had to desig a system for quickly leveling it. The pieces needed to connect securely and align easily without a lip at the join, as this would interfere with the Cyr wheel. We considered many different patterns for the circle and sought a balance between making the pieces small enough to fit through the door and light enough to carry, but not so small that the stage would be difficult or time-consuming to assemble. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/stage-4-367f329abb10ff4d1f0e1eede7a9c0d6.jpg" width="1041" height="773" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We also had to consider the number of legs needed for stability and the speed of the leveling process. The stage had to be durable enough to withstand the rough handling and moisture of circus life. We researched various composite panels and ultimately chose one made of an XPS core sandwiched between two layers of extra durable fibreglass, with a non slip coating.</p><p>The material was cut into the necessary shapes and a hot wire cutter with a rectangular profile was used to remove the foam from the mating edges, leaving only the outer fibreglass material. Adhesive was applied and aluminum extrusion pressed into the edges of the panels. The aluminum provided protection for the edge, supported the edge to prevent deflection, and provided the slot that accommodated the removable leg structure connecting the panels together. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/stage-7-536a8dc3915c3bc552fc3a732e057602.jpg" width="1041" height="773" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/stage-8-27308a0483995332cca67e02fbdec9fc.jpg" width="1058" height="752" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The leg structures were placed at the intersection of three panels and had three pieces of steel box section fitted within the aluminum U channels and welded at 120 degree increments to form a three-directional cross. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/stage-2-96efdfde9bce24cd310ea2c85c3adbb5.jpg" width="1011" height="769" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>A hole was left at the intersection, into which a threaded tube was welded. An internal hex bolt or long grub screw with a foot plate on the bottom was threaded into the tube and could be adjusted from above through a small hole in the stage using an allen key bit on an impact driver. This arrangement allowed for a push-fit assembly process that was fast, and the legs were extended until they touched the ground to level the stage. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/stage-6-2cb158e56730a299f2ecd3b9b490e4ac.jpg" width="1059" height="832" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/stage-1-82e129b0df05a3dc89abe4fe84e5cd34.jpg" width="985" height="1547" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The pieces were held together with inner steel box section curved on the outer curved edge and a large ratchet strap was used to wrap around the entire structure and compress the circle inward, pulling all the pieces together.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/stage-10-ca0b1f0d0eec65bb8455d9793ed7390e.jpg" width="861" height="1302" class="img_ev3q"></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/hola">hola</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/docusaurus">docusaurus</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/mapping-wireless-coverage-at-the-royal-windsor-horse-show-with-arcgis">Mapping Wireless Coverage at the Royal Windsor Horse Show with ArcGIS</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2019-07-01T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 1, 2019</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://reubenliengaard.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Reuben Liengaard</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Maintainer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The Royal Windsor Horse Show is the largest outdoor horse show in the UK.

It was a large site, covering 3km of arenas and fields. Network cabinets were set up in each arena and connected with miles of fiber optic cable. Each cabinet was connected to multiple ADSL connections that were bonded together. Smaller network switches were located within 100m of the cabinet and provided connectivity within the arena. Locations that were beyond the 100m limit for Ethernet were connected with wireless point-to-point links, either from poles attached to the sides of tents or by mounting wireless sectors on cherry pickers that could beam the signal out across the arena, where it could be picked up at distant locations through wireless point-to-point receivers attached to the sides of tents.</p><p>This deployment was massive and complex. While we had a site plan and list of locations that needed connectivity, the physical network structure had to be adapted to the site during construction. We had to navigate around obstacles such as roads and areas of the arena that were accessible to the public. Each main cabinet and sub-cabinet needed its own power supply, which we had to coordinate with the electricians on the fly. Sometimes, if they had been to a location before us, we could locate our cabinets near their distribution boxes by following their cables. Other times, they would move the distribution boxes or we would arrive first and they would provide us with one.</p><p>At least one cherry picker, equipped with a pan-tilt-zoom CCTV camera, was stationed within each arena. CCTV cameras were also installed on scaffolding poles, gateway arches, and stage sides. All bars needed connectivity for their payment terminals. WiFi was provided in the crew and camping areas, and temporary offices were equipped with temporary WiFi and VoIP phones for both internal and external communication. This was necessary because the cellular network often becomes overloaded with the high number of people at events.</p><p>We utilized QGIS&#x27;s &#x27;Align Raster&#x27; tool to georeference a high-definition image of the site map. We then uploaded this map to Mapbox and created a basic Leaflet.js web map that used the host phone&#x27;s geolocation to position a marker on the map. This helped us determine our exact location on the map, as physical landmarks were not always visible since the site was under construction. The map helped us identify which tents required connectivity and aided us in orienting ourselves with the site as we walked around.</p><p>We used the &#x27;Map Marker&#x27; app on Android to quickly locate network devices as we deployed them. The devices were categorized as AP (access point), SW (switch), RT (router), PTZ (CCTV), VoIP (phone), PTP (point-to-point wireless), and cable types of CAT5 and Fibre. Since the staff members who investigate faults or retrieve hardware after an event are often different from those who deployed it, it can be difficult to locate the devices. A detailed and up-to-date map that shows the locations and connections of all the devices helps to quickly trace faults in the network, which often requires physically searching through tents to find cables.</p><p>When the event was finished, the map was used to quickly locate and retrieve all the equipment.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/hello">hello</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/docusaurus">docusaurus</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/live-network-map-for-womad-festival">Live Network Map for WOMAD Festival - Visualizing Status and Coverage</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2019-05-10T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 10, 2019</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://reubenliengaard.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Reuben Liengaard</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Maintainer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>&quot;We created a web application that requests permission to access the user&#x27;s location data. When the location of a network device needs to be recorded, the user enters the device&#x27;s MAC address into the app. This MAC address is checked against a list of available device MAC addresses in the database. If the MAC address exists in the database, it is marked as &quot;deployed&quot; and the coordinates of the user&#x27;s phone, on which the update was made, are added to the latitude and longitude columns. If the MAC address is entered incorrectly or does not correspond to a device in the database, the app user is notified and asked to enter a different MAC address. Deployed devices are displayed on a map in real-time and can be clicked on to view information about them, such as their device type, MAC address, IP address, or selected for deletion. If a device is selected for deletion, the corresponding value in the &quot;deployment status&quot; column is changed to &quot;false&quot; and the latitude and longitude position values are removed from the latitude and longitude columns.&quot;</p><p>A BASH script was developed to produce fake data for testing the app. One of these scripts, written in Linux shell language, generates a CSV file containing random MAC addresses, asset tags, device models, and locations. This CSV file is then uploaded to the database for testing purposes.</p><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block"

The &quot;descriptivegroup&quot; column likely contains an array of descriptive tags or categories associated with each topographic area. By searching for rows where &quot;Natural Environment&quot; is present in this array, the query is able to identify topographic areas that are potentially characterized by natural environments such as forests, wetlands, or other wild areas. These areas could potentially be rewilded or restored in order to provide corridors for wildlife to move through urban environments. The results of this query could be used to inform planning and conservation efforts to enhance biodiversity and improve the connectivity of natural habitats in urban areas.</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sql codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">SELECT</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">*</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">FROM</span><span class="token plain"> topographicarea</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">WHERE</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">&#x27;Natural Environment&#x27;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">ANY</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token plain">descriptivegroup</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/wildlife-corridors-2-eb49b628a2413b5bc0ee68d7928e2cb7.png" width="1515" height="779" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/wildlife-corridors-2-eb49b628a2413b5bc0ee68d7928e2cb7.png" width="1515" height="779" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You can see how the edges or roads and railway tracs could be used as wildlife corridors.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/wildlife-corridors-3-c269ec2c78bdda23a3a61fd8e8005f4b.png" width="1515" height="779" class="img_ev3q"></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/hello">hello</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/docusaurus">docusaurus</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/wireless-coverage-at-the-bath-festival-a-heatmap-analasis">Wireless Coverage at the Bath Festival - A Heatmap Analysis</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2018-04-08T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">April 8, 2018</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://reubenliengaard.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Reuben Liengaard</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Maintainer</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A small deployment of access points was placed around the tents at the Bath Festival.
