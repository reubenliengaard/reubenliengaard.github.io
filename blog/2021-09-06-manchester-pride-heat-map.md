# Wireless Coverage at Manchester Pride - A Heatmap Analysis

During this deployment, we faced a physically challenging task. We mounted two sectors on the 18th floor of a tower block that was next to the site. From there, we transmitted the signal to multiple wireless point-to-point stations that were attached to temporary structures and buildings within the site. We also provided indoor wireless coverage in an underground parking garage that was used as one of the event venues. We created a heat map of the wireless signal strength in this area. In addition, we established uplinks at various locations to support ticket booths, CCTV cameras, payment terminals for bars, a production office, and emergency liaison cabins.
