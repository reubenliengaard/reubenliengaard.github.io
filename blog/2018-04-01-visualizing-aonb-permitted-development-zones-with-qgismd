# Visualizing AONB Permitted Development Zones with QGIS

We imported topographic polygons from the OS MasterMap into GIS software, and used the buffer tool to create lines to identify what we could build where. In areas of outstanding beauty, outbuildings over 10m2 in area must be within 20 meters of main dwelling house. We used the buffer tool with a radius of 20 meters on the main dwelling house polygon. If the proposed outbuilding is within 2 meters of the property boundary, it is limited in overall height to only 2.4m. To help us identify the best area to build, we created a buffer around the property boundary. We are allowed to build an outbuilding with a pitched roof up to 4 meters tall (with an eaves height of 2.5 meters) or a flat roof up to 3 meters tall in the area where the buffer around the dwelling house overlaps the inverse of the buffer around the property boundary.
