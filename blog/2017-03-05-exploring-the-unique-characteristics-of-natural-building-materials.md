# Exploring the Unique Characteristics of Natural Building Materials

Inspired by the idea of using natural building materials, we set out to explore the unique characteristics and personalities of each material and use them in innovative ways in our design. We wanted to capture the mood and atmosphere of the natural environments where these materials are typically found, such as the underground world of stone and water or the airy heights of wood.

To this end, we experimented with lightweight hazel structures as a way to combine wood and air in our design. We were particularly interested in the underground world of stone and water, and decided to dig a tunnel into the side of a hill to see what we could discover. Unfortunately, the largest cavity we found was only two feet wide, and we had to come up with a different solution to support the roof of the tunnel. We ended up building concrete block load-bearing walls with concrete lintels supporting the stone above, which took up a lot of space and lost some of the rustic charm of our original design, but was necessary for safety.

According to our cross-sectional diagram, there is a third layer between the stone and wood in our design - a thin layer of mud from which all life springs. While we have not yet conducted extensive research on using mud as a building material, we have done extensive research and design work on the organic life that it can support. In our design, we envision the wood as the ideal location for sleeping quarters, warm and dry in the loft, while the ground floor would be reserved for the kitchen, toilet, and other organic activities, including food production. There may also be some kind of underground stone cavernous space beneath the building for an as-yet-unknown purpose.

Overall, our goal in this project was to use natural building materials in unique and innovative ways that captured the mood and atmosphere of the natural environments where these materials are typically found. While we encountered some challenges along the way, the process was exciting and rewarding, and we are proud of the design we have created.
