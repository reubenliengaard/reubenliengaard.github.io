# Designing a Living Building: An Organism with a Symbiotic Relationship with Its Occupants

When designing a building, it is important to consider the building as an organism that has a symbiotic relationship with its occupants. This means that the building should be organized like a system of interdependent organisms, with each organism fulfilling a specific function within the larger structure. By treating the building as an organism, we can create a dynamic and self-sustaining ecosystem that supports the health and well-being of its occupants.

There are many different types of organisms that can be incorporated into the design of a building. Some examples might include microalgae, which can be used for wastewater treatment and oxygen production; vermiculture, which can be used for composting and soil improvement; fish, which can be used for food production and waste management; guinea pigs, which can be used for research and education; leafy green plants, which can be used for air purification and aesthetics; and bacteria, which can be used for biological processes such as fermentation and nutrient cycling.

The building itself should function like a shell or frame that provides a home for these organisms. By using environment-specific creatures, it is possible to keep different systems separate, creating an urban jungle inside the building. This approach allows for the creation of a diverse and self-sustaining ecosystem within the building, providing numerous benefits to the occupants such as improved air quality, food production, and waste management. By considering the building as an organism with a symbiotic relationship with its occupants, we can design buildings that are more dynamic, self-sustaining, and supportive of human health and well-being.
