# Designing a Living Building: An Organism with a Symbiotic Relationship with Its Occupants

We should consider the building as an organism with a symbiotic relationship with its occupants. The building should be organized like a system of interdependent organisms, with each organism fulfilling a specific function within the larger structure. These organisms might include microalgae, vermiculture, fish, guinea pigs, leafy green plants, and bacteria. The building should function like a shell or frame that provides a home for these organisms, and we can use environment-specific creatures to keep different systems separate, creating an urban jungle inside the building.
