# Truss Connection Node Modeling

![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/truss-3.png)


We created a dodecahedron-shaped structural node for a truss, which is a device that joins multiple truss struts together at a single point. The node had 12 pentagonal faces, and each truss strut was attached to the center of one of these faces via a single bolt. This bolt passed through a hole in the center of the end cap of the strut and was secured in place by screwing it into a threaded hole in the center of the dodecahedron face. The node was made of steel and was capable of resisting the forces transmitted through the truss.

It played a crucial role in distributing loads evenly and maintaining the stability and strength of the truss. The use of a single bolt per strut allowed for a high level of flexibility and adaptability, as the struts could be easily rearranged or removed due to their modular design.
