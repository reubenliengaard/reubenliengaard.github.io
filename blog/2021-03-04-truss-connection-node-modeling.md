# Truss Connection Node Modeling

![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/truss-3.png)


In this project, we designed and fabricated a dodecahedron-shaped structural node for use in a truss system. A truss is a structural element that consists of a series of interconnected struts, which work together to distribute loads evenly and maintain the stability and strength of the structure. The node we created had 12 pentagonal faces, and each truss strut was attached to the center of one of these faces via a single bolt. This bolt passed through a hole in the center of the end cap of the strut and was secured in place by screwing it into a threaded hole in the center of the dodecahedron face.

The node was made of steel and was designed to resist the forces transmitted through the truss. Its dodecahedron shape and the use of a single bolt per strut allowed for a high level of flexibility and adaptability, as the struts could be easily rearranged or removed due to their modular design. This feature made the node a crucial element in the overall design of the truss, as it enabled the structure to be easily modified or altered to meet changing needs or requirements.

Overall, the dodecahedron-shaped structural node we created proved to be an effective and efficient solution for joining multiple truss struts together at a single point. It played a vital role in distributing loads evenly and maintaining the stability and strength of the truss, and its modular design allowed for flexibility and adaptability in the overall structure.
