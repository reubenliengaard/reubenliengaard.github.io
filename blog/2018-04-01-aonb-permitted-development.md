We imported topographic polygons from the OS MasterMap into GIS software, and used the buffer tool to create lines. In areas of outstanding beauty, development must be at least 20 meters away from the main dwelling house, so we used the buffer tool with a radius of 20 meters on the main dwelling house polygon. If the proposed outbuilding is within 2 meters of the property boundary, the eaves must not be more than 3 meters high. To help us identify this area, we created a buffer around the property boundary. We are allowed to build an outbuilding with a pitched roof up to 4 meters tall (with an eaves height of 2.5 meters) or a flat roof up to 3 meters tall in the area where the buffer around the dwelling house overlaps the inverse of the buffer around the property boundary.
