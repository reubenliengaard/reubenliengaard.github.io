# Mounting Wireless Hardware

Wireless access points and point-to-point links are installed on the aluminum extrusion structural elements of outdoor event marquees using a system that utilizes a keeder rail. This rail accommodates a cylindrical metal piece with a threaded hole drilled perpendicular to its length. This metal piece can slide along the keeder rail and be secured in place by turning a large, flat disk with a threaded hole in the center to tighten it in. This setup supports a pipe clamp that fits standard aluminum poles. Two of these are used per pole, to securly anchor the pole vertically on the side of the tent.
