# Creating a modular circular stage
We were asked to design and build a circular stage for a Cyr wheel performance in Gifford's Circus. The stage had to have a diameter of 6 meters and be able to be broken down into pieces small enough to fit through the 3 meter wide door of the circus tent.

It also had to be sturdy enough to support the weight of the performers, but light enough to be easily assembled by two people in a few minutes. The stage had to be flat and level, even on rough ground, and have a system for quickly leveling it. The pieces needed to connect securely and align easily without leaving a bump at the join, as this would interfere with the Cyr wheel. We considered many different patterns for the circle and sought a balance between making the pieces small enough to fit through the door and light enough to carry, but not so small that the stage would be difficult or time-consuming to assemble and have too many joins.

We also had to consider the number of legs needed for stability and the speed of the leveling process. The stage had to be durable enough to withstand the rough handling and moisture of circus life. We researched various composite panels and ultimately chose one made of an XPS core sandwiched between two layers of glass fiber and coated with a hard, durable floor paint. 


The material was cut into the necessary shapes and had a hot wire cutter with a rectangular profile used to remove the foam from the mating edges, leaving only the outer material. An aluminum extrusion was then bonded to the space with adhesive. The aluminum provided protection for the edge, supported the edge to prevent deflection, and had a slot that accommodated the removable leg structure connecting the panels.

The leg structures were placed at the intersection of three panels and had three pieces of steel box section fitted within the aluminum U channels and welded at 120 degree increments to form a three-directional cross.

A hole was left at the intersection, into which a threaded tube was welded. An internal hex bolt or long grub screw with a foot plate on the bottom was threaded into the tube and could be adjusted from above through a small hole in the stage using an allen key bit on an impact driver. This arrangement allowed for a push-fit assembly process that was fast, and the legs were extended until they touched the ground to level the stage.

The pieces were held together with inner steel box section curved on the outer curved edge and a large ratchet strap was used to wrap around the entire structure and compress the circle inward, pulling all the pieces together.
