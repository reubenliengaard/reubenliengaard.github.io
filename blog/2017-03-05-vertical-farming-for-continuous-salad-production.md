# Vertical Farming for Continuous Salad Production

Our team has an innovative idea for a self-sustaining salad bar that utilizes vertical space to meet production needs. We propose planting seedlings in a steel cable reinforced fiber matting that hangs vertically above the counter. This matting would be supported by two large drums at the top and bottom, and would be able to rotate at a speed calculated based on the height of the assembly, the maturation time of the chosen crop, and the desired harvesting frequency. This way, a seedling planted at the bottom would be ready for harvest by the time it reaches the top and returns to the bottom. With this system, the salad bar would be able to achieve perpetual harvesting, meeting its demand for fresh produce without having to rely on traditional terrestrial agriculture methods.

In addition to this innovative planting system, we also propose supplying the plants with dissolved nutrients by producing an ultrasonic fog in the chamber between the two planting surfaces. This would help to ensure that the plants have all the nutrients they need to grow and thrive. To maintain a stable temperature for the plants, we suggest using a vertical poly tunnel in colder climates to protect them from temperature fluctuations.

Overall, our self-sustaining salad bar concept would be a revolutionary way to meet the demand for fresh produce in a sustainable and efficient manner. By utilizing vertical space and innovative technologies, we believe this concept has the potential to revolutionize the way that salad bars and other food establishments source their produce.
