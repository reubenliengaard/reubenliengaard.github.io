# Vertical Farming for Continuous Salad Production

We have an idea for a self-sustaining salad bar that utilizes vertical space to meet production needs. Conventional terrestrial agriculture methods are not practical for accessing crops at heights, so we propose planting seedlings in a steel cable reinforced fiber matting that hangs vertically above the counter. This matting is supported by two large drums at the top and bottom and rotates at a speed calculated based on the height of the assembly, the maturation time of the chosen crop, and the desired harvesting frequency. This way, a seedling planted at the bottom will be ready for harvest by the time it reaches the top and returns to the bottom. Once fully stocked, this system will allow for perpetual harvesting to meet the salad bar's demand for fresh produce. We also propose supplying the plants with dissolved nutrients by producing an ultrasonic fog in the chamber between the two planting surfaces. Maintaining a stable temperature in this internal space will help the plants survive small outdoor temperature fluctuations. In colder climates, a vertical poly tunnel may be necessary to protect the plants.
