# Mapping Wireless Coverage at the Royal Windsor Horse Show with ArcGIS



The Royal Windsor Horse Show is the largest outdoor horse show in the UK. We provided connectivity to the staff and trader areas. After deployment, a wireless heat map was created by taking geolocated signal strength readings on a smartphone from all over the site. This data was uploaded into ArcGIS and used to create a heat map, which highlighted areas with weak signal strength or wireless black spots. This heat map was overlaid on a georeferenced site map, with the locations of wireless access points, cable routes, and network switch locations marked.
