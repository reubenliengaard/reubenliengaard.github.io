# Bath Festival - Ruckus wireless heatmap

A small deployment of Ruckus R600 access points was placed around the tents at the Bath Festival. Each access point was connected to a sector on an adjacent building via a point-to-point wireless link, connected to both a VDSL line and a temporary satellite on the roof. Using an Android app, I collected a series of geolocated signal strength data points and formatted them in Excel. This data was then uploaded into ArcGIS, where a tool was used to create a heat map, which was overlayed over the site plan.
