After deployment, a wireless heat map was created by extensively taking geolocated signal strength readings on a smartphone from all over the site. This data was uploaded into ArcGIS and used to create a heat map, which highlighted areas with weak signal strength or wireless black spots. This heat map was overlaid on a georeferenced site map, with the locations of wireless access points, cable routes, and network switch locations marked.]]></summary>
