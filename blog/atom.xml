        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As engineers and designers, it is our duty to create structures that not only function well, but also enhance the lives of those who use them. This is particularly important in the design of motor caravans, which serve as both vehicles and living spaces for travelers. With this in mind, we set out to design a caravan that prioritized both comfort and practicality.</p><p>The first step in our process was to choose the most suitable materials and construction techniques. We decided to use a thick layer of spray foam as the foundation for the caravan's shape, which was then carved back to the desired form and rendered with acrylic putty. This method allowed us to create a strong and lightweight structure, while also providing excellent insulation to keep the interior comfortable.</p><p>Next, we focused on the layout of the interior space. We installed a single bed lengthways, with a desk running parallel to it. This arrangement allowed for maximum use of the limited space, while also providing a comfortable and functional sleeping and working area. In addition, we designed the layout in such a way that the user can easily walk from the back of the caravan to the side door unhindered, which gives flexibility in terms of access and egress.</p><p>To ensure practicality, we also included a bulkhead kitchen with a water-saving faucet, a full-size fridge, and a hob. These features allow the user to easily prepare meals and store food while on the road. We also installed double-layered Ikea blackout blinds and windows all around to provide privacy and regulate light and temperature within the caravan.</p><p>Overall, our design for this motor caravan prioritizes both comfort and practicality, making it an ideal living space for travelers. By carefully considering the materials, layout, and features, we have created a functional and enjoyable space that will enhance the experience of those who use it.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/ergo-1-cc394510540878b1db9af7ab6425ba6e.png" width="950" height="531" class="img_ev3q">

To this end, our team combined three separate files containing price paid data into a single file and cleaned and filtered the data through a series of steps. These steps included the removal of quotes, the selection of only rows with "GL" followed by a number, the printing of certain columns, the addition of column names, and the deletion of rows with null values.</p><p>Once the data was cleaned and organized, we used the powerful tool ogr2ogr to convert a file with cadastral parcel information into a PostgreSQL file. We then changed the projection from OSGB to WGS84 and imported it into a database. In order to store the data in a structured manner, we started a psql session and created empty tables with certain columns in the database.</p><p>Next, we used the \copy command and SQL JOIN to combine the price and coordinates data based on their shared postcodes. We added a column for geometry data and used the latitude and longitude data to create points. We then calculated the average value for each of the duplicate polygons.</p><p>Finally, we used the powerful mapping software QGIS to export the table from the database and modified the layer properties for visual appeal.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As engineers and designers, we are often approached with unusual and challenging requests. One such request came from an artist who asked us to help find a suitable geometry for a large egg sculpture. Intrigued by the opportunity to collaborate with an artist and apply our skills in a creative context, we set out to identify possible geometries using generative algorithms in Grasshopper 3D.</p><p>The first step in our process was to understand the constraints and requirements of the project. The artist provided us with a set of parameters, including the desired size and shape of the sculpture, as well as the materials that would be used to construct it. With this information in hand, we began to explore different algorithmic approaches that could be used to generate a range of possible geometries.</p><p>We turned to Grasshopper 3D, a powerful tool for generative design that allows users to define and manipulate geometry through a series of algorithmic rules. Using a combination of mathematical functions and input from the artist, we were able to generate a range of potential geometries for the egg sculpture.</p><p>To narrow down our options and select the most suitable geometry, we used a variety of methods to evaluate and compare the different options. We considered factors such as structural integrity, ease of fabrication, and aesthetic appeal, and used computer simulations and physical prototypes to test the performance of the different geometries.</p><p>In the end, we were able to identify a geometry that met all of the requirements and constraints of the project. The artist was pleased with the result and used our geometry to create a stunning egg sculpture that was well-received by the public.</p><p>This project was a rewarding and exciting example of the ways in which engineering and design can intersect with the arts. By using generative algorithms and a collaborative approach, we were able to help an artist realize their vision and create a beautiful work of art.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/egg-1-2edd5330f8680fdf901b10dfe36b1e4f.jpg" width="655" height="527" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/egg-2-128d75277af2454dd729a83dce079a5f.jpg" width="1209" height="512" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this project, we aimed to successfully install and configure the Cisco Catalyst c9800-CL wireless controller using KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). The c9800-CL is a powerful and flexible cloud-based wireless controller that is capable of managing both on-premises and cloud-based wireless networks. It belongs to the Cisco Catalyst 9800 series and offers a range of advanced features such as wireless intrusion prevention, location services, and guest access.</p><p>To begin, we installed virtualization software and enabled the libvirtd service on our system. This allowed us to create and manage virtual machines using KVM. We then created a network bridge using the brctl command, which enabled communication between the virtual machine and the host system.</p><p>With the necessary infrastructure in place, we used the virt-install command to install the c9800-CL on a new virtual machine. During the installation process, we specified a number of options such as the connection to the virtualization server, the operating system variant, the architecture of the virtual machine, and the CPU type.</p><p>Once the virtual machine was set up and the c9800-CL was installed, we provided a script to configure the controller. This script contained a series of steps that were necessary to properly set up the c9800-CL. These steps included setting the hostname, creating a user account, configuring the Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, creating a VLAN, setting up static routes, shutting down and re-enabling the radio frequencies, and setting the country code. We also configured the virtual wireless LAN controller (VWLC) and set the DNS and NTP servers to ensure proper network connectivity and synchronization.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrated how to access the GUI of the c9800-CL at the specified IP address and walk through the zero-day configuration steps to set up a wireless network. By following these steps, users can easily configure the c9800-CL to meet the specific needs of their wireless network.</p>]]></content>

A truss is a structural element that consists of a series of interconnected struts, which work together to distribute loads evenly and maintain the stability and strength of the structure. The node we created had 12 pentagonal faces, and each truss strut was attached to the center of one of these faces via a single bolt. This bolt passed through a hole in the center of the end cap of the strut and was secured in place by screwing it into a threaded hole in the center of the dodecahedron face.</p><p>The node was made of steel and was designed to resist the forces transmitted through the truss. Its dodecahedron shape and the use of a single bolt per strut allowed for a high level of flexibility and adaptability, as the struts could be easily rearranged or removed due to their modular design. This feature made the node a crucial element in the overall design of the truss, as it enabled the structure to be easily modified or altered to meet changing needs or requirements.</p><p>Overall, the dodecahedron-shaped structural node we created proved to be an effective and efficient solution for joining multiple truss struts together at a single point. It played a vital role in distributing loads evenly and maintaining the stability and strength of the truss, and its modular design allowed for flexibility and adaptability in the overall structure.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/truss-1-262854f9f04c2addb3451e2e0e292058.jpg" width="476" height="442" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/truss-2-246d90b00e94dc787904ed511746731a.jpg" width="4592" height="3448" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Ordnance Survey Mastermap Topography Layer, the Building Height Attribute (BHA), and the Environment Agency LiDAR Digital Terrain Model (DTM) are all useful data sources that can be used to create 3D models of buildings. By combining this data and using the Qgis2ThreeJS plugin in QGIS, it is possible to visualize the BHA data in 3D and create a 3D model of a building.</p><p>To do this, the Qgis2ThreeJS plugin must be installed and the BHA data, DTM data, and any additional desired layers must be loaded into the QGIS project. The plugin can then be used to style the BHA data and specify the desired height attribute for extrusion, resulting in a 3D model of the building. This model can be saved as an HTML file and viewed in a web browser.</p><p>When combined with the LiDAR DTM, the resulting 3D model is fairly accurate and can be opened in Grasshopper, a visual programming language and environment that runs within the Rhinoceros 3D CAD application. With the addition of the Ladybug plugin, this 3D model can be used to perform detailed analyses of climate data and create customized, interactive visualizations for environmentally-informed design, such as sunlight studies.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/bha-1-43f5d793112b5e7d965dd45b486ad82e.png" width="849" height="519" class="img_ev3q">

The stage had to meet several requirements: it had to have a diameter of 6 meters, be able to be disassembled into pieces small enough to fit through a door with a width of 2.6 meters, be able to support the weight of performers, be easy to assemble by two people in a short amount of time (with each panel weighing no more than 50kg), be flat and level on rough ground, and be durable enough to withstand the rough handling and moisture of circus life.</p><p>To achieve these goals, we considered various designs for the circle and ultimately settled on a composite panel made of an XPS core sandwiched between two layers of extra durable fibreglass, with a non-slip coating. The material was cut into the necessary shapes using a hot wire cutter with a rectangular profile, and the foam was removed from the mating edges, leaving only the outer fibreglass material. Adhesive was applied and aluminum extrusion was pressed into the edges of the panels. The aluminum provided protection for the edges, supported the edges to prevent deflection, and provided slots for the removable leg structures that connected the panels together.</p><p>The leg structures were placed at the intersection of three panels and consisted of three pieces of steel box section fitted within aluminum U channels and welded at 120-degree increments to form a three-directional cross. A hole was left at the intersection, into which a threaded tube was welded. An internal hex bolt or long grub screw with a foot plate on the bottom was threaded into the tube and could be adjusted from above through a small hole in the stage using an allen key bit on an impact driver. This arrangement allowed for a quick and easy assembly process, with the legs being extended until they touched the ground to level the stage. The pieces were held together with inner steel box sections curved on the outer curved edges, and a large ratchet strap was used to wrap around the entire structure and compress the circle inward, pulling all the pieces together.</p><p>Overall, the design and construction of the circular stage was a challenging but rewarding project. We were able to meet all of the requirements set forth by the client and create a stage that was durable, stable, and easy to assemble and transport. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/stage-7-536a8dc3915c3bc552fc3a732e057602.jpg" width="1041" height="773" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="/assets/images/stage-8-27308a0483995332cca67e02fbdec9fc.jpg" width="1058" height="752" class="img_ev3q">

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Isle of Wight Festival 2019 was a large-scale event that took place at Seaclose Park on the Isle of Wight. With 3km of arenas and fields to cover, the deployment of the network was a massive and complex undertaking. To ensure that the site was properly connected, network cabinets were set up in each arena and connected with miles of fiber optic cable. These cabinets were then connected to multiple ADSL connections that were bonded together, providing a robust and reliable internet connection.</p><p>To provide connectivity within each arena, smaller network switches were located within 100m of the cabinets. Locations that were beyond this range were connected with wireless point-to-point links, which were either mounted on poles attached to the sides of tents or beam out across the arena from wireless sectors mounted on cherry pickers. These signals were then picked up at distant locations through wireless point-to-point receivers attached to the sides of tents.</p><p>In addition to the network infrastructure, the event also required a comprehensive CCTV system to ensure the safety of attendees. To this end, at least one cherry picker equipped with a pan-tilt-zoom CCTV camera was stationed within each arena, with additional cameras installed on scaffolding poles, gateway arches, and stage sides. WiFi was also provided in the crew and camping areas, and temporary offices were equipped with temporary WiFi and VoIP phones for both internal and external communication.</p><p>To aid in the deployment and management of the network, we utilized a number of tools and resources. For example, we used QGIS's 'Align Raster' tool to georeference a high-definition image of the site map, which we then uploaded to Mapbox and used to create a basic Leaflet.js web map. This map used the host phone's geolocation to position a marker, helping us to determine our exact location on the site and identify which tents required connectivity. We also used the 'Map Marker' app on Android to quickly locate network devices as we deployed them.</p><p>After the event, the map was used to quickly locate and retrieve all of the equipment. This was particularly useful as the staff members who investigate faults or retrieve hardware after an event are often different from those who deployed it, making it difficult to locate the devices without a detailed and up-to-date map showing their locations and connections. By using this map, we were able to efficiently trace faults in the network and ensure that all of the equipment was properly accounted for. Overall, the deployment and management of the network at the Isle of Wight Festival was a successful and complex endeavor that helped to ensure the smooth operation of the event.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the Bath Festival, a small deployment of access points was placed around the tents to provide WiFi connectivity to attendees. In order to maximize coverage and ensure reliable connectivity, each access point was connected to a sector on an adjacent building via a point-to-point wireless link. In addition to the wireless link, each access point was also connected to a ADSL line and a temporary satellite on the roof to provide multiple redundant Internet connections.</p><p>To assess the performance of the access points and identify any areas with weak signal strength or wireless black spots, we used an Android app to collect a series of geolocated signal strength data points. These data points were formatted in Excel and then uploaded into ArcGIS, where a tool was used to create a heat map. This heat map was then overlayed over the site plan to provide a visual representation of the signal strength across the festival grounds.</p><p>By collecting and analyzing this data, we were able to identify any areas with weak signal strength or wireless black spots and take steps to improve coverage in these areas. This ensured that attendees were able to access the WiFi network and stay connected throughout the duration of the festival. By using a combination of a point-to-point wireless link, a ADSL line, and a temporary satellite, we were able to provide reliable and redundant Internet connectivity to the festival attendees.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by the idea of using natural building materials, we set out to explore the unique characteristics and personalities of each material and use them in innovative ways in our design. We wanted to capture the mood and atmosphere of the natural environments where these materials are typically found, such as the underground world of stone and water or the airy heights of wood.</p><p>To this end, we experimented with lightweight hazel structures as a way to combine wood and air in our design. We were particularly interested in the underground world of stone and water, and decided to dig a tunnel into the side of a hill to see what we could discover. Unfortunately, the largest cavity we found was only two feet wide, and we had to come up with a different solution to support the roof of the tunnel. We ended up building concrete block load-bearing walls with concrete lintels supporting the stone above, which took up a lot of space and lost some of the rustic charm of our original design, but was necessary for safety.</p><p>According to our cross-sectional diagram, there is a third layer between the stone and wood in our design - a thin layer of mud from which all life springs. While we have not yet conducted extensive research on using mud as a building material, we have done extensive research and design work on the organic life that it can support. In our design, we envision the wood as the ideal location for sleeping quarters, warm and dry in the loft, while the ground floor would be reserved for the kitchen, toilet, and other organic activities, including food production. There may also be some kind of underground stone cavernous space beneath the building for an as-yet-unknown purpose.</p><p>Overall, our goal in this project was to use natural building materials in unique and innovative ways that captured the mood and atmosphere of the natural environments where these materials are typically found. While we encountered some challenges along the way, the process was exciting and rewarding, and we are proud of the design we have created.</p>]]></content>

This would help to ensure that the plants have all the nutrients they need to grow and thrive. To maintain a stable temperature for the plants, we suggest using a vertical poly tunnel in colder climates to protect them from temperature fluctuations.</p><p>Overall, our self-sustaining salad bar concept would be a revolutionary way to meet the demand for fresh produce in a sustainable and efficient manner. By utilizing vertical space and innovative technologies, we believe this concept has the potential to revolutionize the way that salad bars and other food establishments source their produce.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When designing a building, it is important to consider the building as an organism that has a symbiotic relationship with its occupants. This means that the building should be organized like a system of interdependent organisms, with each organism fulfilling a specific function within the larger structure. By treating the building as an organism, we can create a dynamic and self-sustaining ecosystem that supports the health and well-being of its occupants.</p><p>There are many different types of organisms that can be incorporated into the design of a building. Some examples might include microalgae, which can be used for wastewater treatment and oxygen production; vermiculture, which can be used for composting and soil improvement; fish, which can be used for food production and waste management; guinea pigs, which can be used for research and education; leafy green plants, which can be used for air purification and aesthetics; and bacteria, which can be used for biological processes such as fermentation and nutrient cycling.</p><p>The building itself should function like a shell or frame that provides a home for these organisms. By using environment-specific creatures, it is possible to keep different systems separate, creating an urban jungle inside the building. This approach allows for the creation of a diverse and self-sustaining ecosystem within the building, providing numerous benefits to the occupants such as improved air quality, food production, and waste management. By considering the building as an organism with a symbiotic relationship with its occupants, we can design buildings that are more dynamic, self-sustaining, and supportive of human health and well-being.</p>]]></content>
