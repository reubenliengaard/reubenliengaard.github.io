This is particularly important in the design of motor caravans, which serve as both vehicles and living spaces for travelers. With this in mind, we set out to design a caravan that prioritized both comfort and practicality.\\n\\nThe first step in our process was to choose the most suitable materials and construction techniques. We decided to use a thick layer of spray foam as the foundation for the caravan\'s shape, which was then carved back to the desired form and rendered with acrylic putty. This method allowed us to create a strong and lightweight structure, while also providing excellent insulation to keep the interior comfortable.\\n\\nNext, we focused on the layout of the interior space. We installed a single bed lengthways, with a desk running parallel to it. This arrangement allowed for maximum use of the limited space, while also providing a comfortable and functional sleeping and working area. In addition, we designed the layout in such a way that the user can easily walk from the back of the caravan to the side door unhindered, which gives flexibility in terms of access and egress.\\n\\nTo ensure practicality, we also included a bulkhead kitchen with a water-saving faucet, a full-size fridge, and a hob. These features allow the user to easily prepare meals and store food while on the road. We also installed double-layered Ikea blackout blinds and windows all around to provide privacy and regulate light and temperature within the caravan.\\n\\nOverall, our design for this motor caravan prioritizes both comfort and practicality, making it an ideal living space for travelers. By carefully considering the materials, layout, and features, we have created a functional and enjoyable space that will enhance the experience of those who use it.\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-1.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-2.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-3.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-4.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-5.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-6.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-7.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-8.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-9.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-10.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-11.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-12.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/ergo-13.png)"},{"id":"parish-house-prices","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/parish-house-prices","editUrl":"https://github.com/reubenliengaard/blog/2021-09-01-parish-house-prices.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-01-parish-house-prices.md","title":"Parish House Prices - A Map of Average Sale Prices","description":"In order to accurately assess the real estate market, our team utilized property sale data from the land registry and postal code data from the Ordnance Survey to determine the latitude and longitude coordinates of each house sale.

A truss is a structural element that consists of a series of interconnected struts, which work together to distribute loads evenly and maintain the stability and strength of the structure. The node we created had 12 pentagonal faces, and each truss strut was attached to the center of one of these faces via a single bolt. This bolt passed through a hole in the center of the end cap of the strut and was secured in place by screwing it into a threaded hole in the center of the dodecahedron face.\\n\\nThe node was made of steel and was designed to resist the forces transmitted through the truss. Its dodecahedron shape and the use of a single bolt per strut allowed for a high level of flexibility and adaptability, as the struts could be easily rearranged or removed due to their modular design. This feature made the node a crucial element in the overall design of the truss, as it enabled the structure to be easily modified or altered to meet changing needs or requirements.\\n\\nOverall, the dodecahedron-shaped structural node we created proved to be an effective and efficient solution for joining multiple truss struts together at a single point. It played a vital role in distributing loads evenly and maintaining the stability and strength of the truss, and its modular design allowed for flexibility and adaptability in the overall structure.\\n\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/truss-1.jpg)\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/truss-2.jpg)"},{"id":"creating-3d-buildings-from-mastermap-with-qgis","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/creating-3d-buildings-from-mastermap-with-qgis","editUrl":"https://github.com/reubenliengaard/blog/2021-02-02-creating-3d-buildings-from-mastermap-with-qgis.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-02-02-creating-3d-buildings-from-mastermap-with-qgis.md","title":"Creating 3d Buildings From Mastermap With Qgis","description":"The Ordnance Survey Mastermap Topography Layer, the Building Height Attribute (BHA), and the Environment Agency LiDAR Digital Terrain Model (DTM) are all useful data sources that can be used to create 3D models of buildings.

With the addition of the Ladybug plugin, this 3D model can be used to perform detailed analyses of climate data and create customized, interactive visualizations for environmentally-informed design, such as sunlight studies.\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/bha-1.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/bha-2.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/bha-3.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/bha-4.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/bha-5.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/bha-6.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/bha-7.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/bha-8.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/bha-9.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/bha-10.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/bha-11.png)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/bha-12.png)\\n\\n\\n# References\\n[qgis bha](https://digimap.edina.ac.uk/help/gis/qgis/qgis_bha/)"},{"id":"gifford-circus-cry-wheel-performances","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/gifford-circus-cry-wheel-performances","editUrl":"https://github.com/reubenliengaard/blog/2021-02-02-gifford-circus-cry-wheel-performances.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-02-02-gifford-circus-cry-wheel-performances.md","title":"Gifford Circus Cyr Wheel Performances - A Custom Modular Circular Stage","description":"Docusaurus Plushie","date":"2021-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 2, 2021","tags":[{"label":"hola","permalink":"/blog/tags/hola"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":2.18,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Reuben Liengaard","title":"Maintainer","url":"https://reubenliengaard.github.io","key":"reubenliengaard"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"gifford-circus-cry-wheel-performances","title":"Gifford Circus Cyr Wheel Performances - A Custom Modular Circular Stage","authors":"reubenliengaard","tags":["hola","docusaurus"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Creating 3d Buildings From Mastermap With Qgis","permalink":"/blog/creating-3d-buildings-from-mastermap-with-qgis"},"nextItem":{"title":"Mapping Wireless Coverage at the Royal Windsor Horse Show with ArcGIS","permalink":"/blog/mapping-wireless-coverage-at-the-royal-windsor-horse-show-with-arcgis"}},"content":"![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-3.jpg)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-4.jpg)\\n\\n\\n# Gifford Circus Cyr Wheel Performances - A Custom Modular Circular Stage\\nWe were commissioned to design and construct a circular stage for a Cyr wheel performance in Gifford\'s Circus. The stage had to meet several requirements: it had to have a diameter of 6 meters, be able to be disassembled into pieces small enough to fit through a door with a width of 2.6 meters, be able to support the weight of performers, be easy to assemble by two people in a short amount of time (with each panel weighing no more than 50kg), be flat and level on rough ground, and be durable enough to withstand the rough handling and moisture of circus life.\\n\\nTo achieve these goals, we considered various designs for the circle and ultimately settled on a composite panel made of an XPS core sandwiched between two layers of extra durable fibreglass, with a non-slip coating. The material was cut into the necessary shapes using a hot wire cutter with a rectangular profile, and the foam was removed from the mating edges, leaving only the outer fibreglass material. Adhesive was applied and aluminum extrusion was pressed into the edges of the panels. The aluminum provided protection for the edges, supported the edges to prevent deflection, and provided slots for the removable leg structures that connected the panels together.\\n\\nThe leg structures were placed at the intersection of three panels and consisted of three pieces of steel box section fitted within aluminum U channels and welded at 120-degree increments to form a three-directional cross. A hole was left at the intersection, into which a threaded tube was welded. An internal hex bolt or long grub screw with a foot plate on the bottom was threaded into the tube and could be adjusted from above through a small hole in the stage using an allen key bit on an impact driver. This arrangement allowed for a quick and easy assembly process, with the legs being extended until they touched the ground to level the stage. The pieces were held together with inner steel box sections curved on the outer curved edges, and a large ratchet strap was used to wrap around the entire structure and compress the circle inward, pulling all the pieces together.\\n\\nOverall, the design and construction of the circular stage was a challenging but rewarding project. We were able to meet all of the requirements set forth by the client and create a stage that was durable, stable, and easy to assemble and transport. \\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-7.jpg)\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-8.jpg)\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-2.jpg)\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-6.jpg)\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-1.jpg)\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-10.jpg)"},{"id":"mapping-wireless-coverage-at-the-royal-windsor-horse-show-with-arcgis","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mapping-wireless-coverage-at-the-royal-windsor-horse-show-with-arcgis","editUrl":"https://github.com/reubenliengaard/blog/2019-07-01-mapping-wireless-coverage-at-the-royal-windsor-horse-show-with-arcgis.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-07-01-mapping-wireless-coverage-at-the-royal-windsor-horse-show-with-arcgis.md","title":"Mapping Wireless Coverage at the Royal Windsor Horse Show with ArcGIS","description":"The Royal Windsor Horse Show is an annual event that attracts thousands of visitors and is the largest outdoor horse show in the United Kingdom.

To ensure that the site was properly connected, network cabinets were set up in each arena and connected with miles of fiber optic cable. These cabinets were then connected to multiple ADSL connections that were bonded together, providing a robust and reliable internet connection.\\n\\nTo provide connectivity within each arena, smaller network switches were located within 100m of the cabinets. Locations that were beyond this range were connected with wireless point-to-point links, which were either mounted on poles attached to the sides of tents or beam out across the arena from wireless sectors mounted on cherry pickers. These signals were then picked up at distant locations through wireless point-to-point receivers attached to the sides of tents.\\n\\nIn addition to the network infrastructure, the event also required a comprehensive CCTV system to ensure the safety of attendees. To this end, at least one cherry picker equipped with a pan-tilt-zoom CCTV camera was stationed within each arena, with additional cameras installed on scaffolding poles, gateway arches, and stage sides. WiFi was also provided in the crew and camping areas, and temporary offices were equipped with temporary WiFi and VoIP phones for both internal and external communication.\\n\\nTo aid in the deployment and management of the network, we utilized a number of tools and resources. For example, we used QGIS\'s \'Align Raster\' tool to georeference a high-definition image of the site map, which we then uploaded to Mapbox and used to create a basic Leaflet.js web map. This map used the host phone\'s geolocation to position a marker, helping us to determine our exact location on the site and identify which tents required connectivity. We also used the \'Map Marker\' app on Android to quickly locate network devices as we deployed them.\\n\\nAfter the event, the map was used to quickly locate and retrieve all of the equipment. This was particularly useful as the staff members who investigate faults or retrieve hardware after an event are often different from those who deployed it, making it difficult to locate the devices without a detailed and up-to-date map showing their locations and connections. By using this map, we were able to efficiently trace faults in the network and ensure that all of the equipment was properly accounted for. Overall, the deployment and management of the network at the Isle of Wight Festival was a successful and complex endeavor that helped to ensure the smooth operation of the event."},{"id":"live-network-map-for-womad-festival","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/live-network-map-for-womad-festival","editUrl":"https://github.com/reubenliengaard/blog/2019-05-10-live-network-map-for-womad-festival.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-10-live-network-map-for-womad-festival.md","title":"Live Network Map for WOMAD Festival - Visualizing Status and Coverage","description":"The web application we developed allows users to access and update the location data for network devices.

We were particularly interested in the underground world of stone and water, and decided to dig a tunnel into the side of a hill to see what we could discover. Unfortunately, the largest cavity we found was only two feet wide, and we had to come up with a different solution to support the roof of the tunnel. We ended up building concrete block load-bearing walls with concrete lintels supporting the stone above, which took up a lot of space and lost some of the rustic charm of our original design, but was necessary for safety.\\n\\nAccording to our cross-sectional diagram, there is a third layer between the stone and wood in our design - a thin layer of mud from which all life springs. While we have not yet conducted extensive research on using mud as a building material, we have done extensive research and design work on the organic life that it can support. In our design, we envision the wood as the ideal location for sleeping quarters, warm and dry in the loft, while the ground floor would be reserved for the kitchen, toilet, and other organic activities, including food production. There may also be some kind of underground stone cavernous space beneath the building for an as-yet-unknown purpose.\\n\\nOverall, our goal in this project was to use natural building materials in unique and innovative ways that captured the mood and atmosphere of the natural environments where these materials are typically found.

This matting would be supported by two large drums at the top and bottom, and would be able to rotate at a speed calculated based on the height of the assembly, the maturation time of the chosen crop, and the desired harvesting frequency. This way, a seedling planted at the bottom would be ready for harvest by the time it reaches the top and returns to the bottom. With this system, the salad bar would be able to achieve perpetual harvesting, meeting its demand for fresh produce without having to rely on traditional terrestrial agriculture methods.\\n\\nIn addition to this innovative planting system, we also propose supplying the plants with dissolved nutrients by producing an ultrasonic fog in the chamber between the two planting surfaces. This would help to ensure that the plants have all the nutrients they need to grow and thrive. To maintain a stable temperature for the plants, we suggest using a vertical poly tunnel in colder climates to protect them from temperature fluctuations.\\n\\nOverall, our self-sustaining salad bar concept would be a revolutionary way to meet the demand for fresh produce in a sustainable and efficient manner. By utilizing vertical space and innovative technologies, we believe this concept has the potential to revolutionize the way that salad bars and other food establishments source their produce."},{"id":"designing-a-living-building:-an-organism-with-a-symbiotic-relationship-with-its-occupants","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/designing-a-living-building:-an-organism-with-a-symbiotic-relationship-with-its-occupants","editUrl":"https://github.com/reubenliengaard/blog/2017-03-05-water-and-stone.md","source":"@site/blog/2017-03-05-water-and-stone.md","title":"Designing a Living Building - An Organism with a Symbiotic Relationship with Its Occupants","description":"When designing a building, it is important to consider the building as an organism that has a symbiotic relationship with its occupants.

This means that the building should be organized like a system of interdependent organisms, with each organism fulfilling a specific function within the larger structure. By treating the building as an organism, we can create a dynamic and self-sustaining ecosystem that supports the health and well-being of its occupants.\\n\\nThere are many different types of organisms that can be incorporated into the design of a building. Some examples might include microalgae, which can be used for wastewater treatment and oxygen production; vermiculture, which can be used for composting and soil improvement; fish, which can be used for food production and waste management; guinea pigs, which can be used for research and education; leafy green plants, which can be used for air purification and aesthetics; and bacteria, which can be used for biological processes such as fermentation and nutrient cycling.\\n\\nThe building itself should function like a shell or frame that provides a home for these organisms. By using environment-specific creatures, it is possible to keep different systems separate, creating an urban jungle inside the building. This approach allows for the creation of a diverse and self-sustaining ecosystem within the building, providing numerous benefits to the occupants such as improved air quality, food production, and waste management. By considering the building as an organism with a symbiotic relationship with its occupants, we can design buildings that are more dynamic, self-sustaining, and supportive of human health and well-being."}]}')}}]);
