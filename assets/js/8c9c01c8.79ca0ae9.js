To do this, we are exploring different building systems and considering how they can be redesigned or integrated to improve their efficiency. We want the form of the building to reflect the elegance and creativity of its organization, and we want the building systems to be visible and constructed with materials that match their character.\nWe are focused on synthesizing the minimum number of building technologies needed to fulfill the design brief for each specific building, in order to create a unique and functional building. To start, we created a large web diagram of different technologies and how they could be integrated to serve the occupant. From this web, we can draw connections to create smaller conceptual designs, which we call "flows." To give these flows a physical shape, we need to calculate the size of their components relative to each other. However, the unique scaling ratios of these components and the fact that we have not yet defined their exact 3d arrangement make it difficult to have a detailed understanding of their size. As a result, we use rough rules of thumb to estimate their relative sizes.\nNow that we have these parts relatively scaled in 2d or 3d, we can begin to create 3d conceptual designs. We can explore their aesthetic and ergonomic qualities, and either iterate through a feedback loop for a more detailed analysis of their behavior or move directly into building models to test their functionality and consider suitable materials for their structure and appearance.'))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
