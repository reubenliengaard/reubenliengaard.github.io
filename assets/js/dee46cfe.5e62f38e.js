For example, we used QGIS's 'Align Raster' tool to georeference a high-definition image of the site map, which we then uploaded to Mapbox and used to create a basic Leaflet.js web map. This map used the host phone's geolocation to position a marker, helping us to determine our exact location on the site and identify which tents required connectivity. We also used the 'Map Marker' app on Android to quickly locate network devices as we deployed them."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"After the event, the map was used to quickly locate and retrieve all of the equipment. This was particularly useful as the staff members who investigate faults or retrieve hardware after an event are often different from those who deployed it, making it difficult to locate the devices without a detailed and up-to-date map showing their locations and connections. By using this map, we were able to efficiently trace faults in the network and ensure that all of the equipment was properly accounted for. Overall, the deployment and management of the network at the Isle of Wight Festival was a successful and complex endeavor that helped to ensure the smooth operation of the event."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
