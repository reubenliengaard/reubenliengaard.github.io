It is a term used in a variety of contexts, including semantics, design, electronics, and software programming. A prototype is generally used to evaluate a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users. Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real, working system rather than a theoretical one.[3] In some design workflow models, creating a prototype (a process sometimes called materialization) is the step between the formalization and the evaluation of an idea.","slug":"/category/prototype","permalink":"/docs/category/prototype","navigation":{"previous":{"title":"Cisco Wireless Cloud Controller","permalink":"/docs/automation/automation-virtual-machines/cisco-wireless-cloud-controller"},"next":{"title":"Products","permalink":"/docs/category/products"}}}')}}]);
