While we had a site plan and list of locations that needed connectivity, the physical network structure had to be adapted to the site during construction. We had to navigate around obstacles such as roads and areas of the arena that were accessible to the public. Each main cabinet and sub-cabinet needed its own power supply, which we had to coordinate with the electricians on the fly.
