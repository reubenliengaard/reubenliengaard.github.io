Inspired by what I saw in the Arup Journal I developed a love for the characteristics of thin shell structures. I built hundreds of woven structures out of hazel. The materials limited rigidity led me to developed a torus shaped design. Later this fascination with form drew me to study traditional wooden boat building.

Later we would re-enforce the tunnel with concrete."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"At school in a lesson on the history of architecture, my teacher had emphasized the necessity of a thorough understanding of materials.

I discovered a wealth of information on the FAO website. I was inspired by projects undertaken by the New Alchemy Institute, in the field ecological system engineering. My uncle introduced me to Spirulina, a micro algae he had encountered being cultivated in Africa. It apparently contained a perfect nutritional balance to sustain human life, with an unrivaled growth rate. I began researching ways in which photo bioreactors could be integrated into buildings.

I wanted to explore building technologies and create a visual typology of structural elements. I discovered a collection of color-coded material selection charts; I would use these colors for subsequent drawings. I wanted to make physical models of each kind of structure. I was led to research form finding software, computational geometry, physical form finding with saturated cloth models and fabric formed plaster. Recently I began creatively combining technologies, leading me to research conductive heat transfer between the cooling graph of a body of water and an annual outside temperature graph, and how wall conductivity and mass effects this. I\u2019ve conducted research into vacuums and vacuum insulated solar hot water systems. The power of large lenses for concentrating solar energy, the possibility of reducing the cost of optical technology by replacing glass with water or mineral oil.

Now I feel it necessary to broaden my understanding with the depth of knowledge only available through a university education. I wanted to investigate the functional technologies of buildings as a foundation before I proceeded to pursue sociological or aesthetic considerations.  I hope a course of study will slowly fill in the gaps between my interests as they homogenize evolve and solidify into the form of my future practice. I very much look forward to bouncing ideas off tutors and peers as we work together to develop increasingly resilient architecture."))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
