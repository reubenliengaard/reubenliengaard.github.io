We wanted to place each material in its proper location within the building based on where it is most commonly found in nature. For example, we know that stone is typically found underground and often in conjunction with water, while wood is found on the surface and high in the air. We wanted to capture the mood of these natural environments in our design.\nWe explored the combination of wood and air through lightweight hazel structures, and we were particularly interested in the mysterious underground world of stone and water. We decided to dig a tunnel into the side of a hill to see what we could discover, but the largest cavity we found was only two feet wide. Despite the challenges, it was an exciting and rewarding experience.\nTo support the roof of the tunnel, we ended up building concrete block load-bearing walls with concrete lintels supporting the stone above. This solution took up a lot of space and lost the rustic charm of the original design, but it was necessary for safety.\nAccording to our cross-sectional diagram, there is a third layer in between the stone and wood, a thin layer of mud from which all life springs. We have not researched this material as thoroughly as the others for use in construction, but we have conducted extensive research and design in regards to the organic life it can support. We envision the wood as the ideal location for sleeping quarters, dry and warm in the loft. The ground floor would be reserved for the kitchen, toilet, and other organic activities, including food production. Finally, there may be some kind of underground stone cavernous space beneath the building for an as-yet-unknown purpose."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
