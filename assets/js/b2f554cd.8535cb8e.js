The stage had to have a diameter of 6 meters and be able to be broken down into pieces small enough to fit through the 3 meter wide door of the circus tent. \\n\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-3.jpg)\\n\\n\\nIt also had to be sturdy enough to support the weight of the performers, but light enough to be easily assembled by two people in a few minutes. The stage had to be flat and level, even on rough ground, and have a system for quickly leveling it. The pieces needed to connect securely and align easily without leaving a bump at the join, as this would interfere with the Cyr wheel. We considered many different patterns for the circle and sought a balance between making the pieces small enough to fit through the door and light enough to carry, but not so small that the stage would be difficult or time-consuming to assemble and have too many joins. \\n\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-4.jpg)\\n\\nWe also had to consider the number of legs needed for stability and the speed of the leveling process. The stage had to be durable enough to withstand the rough handling and moisture of circus life. We researched various composite panels and ultimately chose one made of an XPS core sandwiched between two layers of glass fiber and coated with a hard, durable floor paint. \\n\\n\\nThe material was cut into the necessary shapes and had a hot wire cutter with a rectangular profile used to remove the foam from the mating edges, leaving only the outer material. An aluminum extrusion was then bonded to the space with adhesive. The aluminum provided protection for the edge, supported the edge to prevent deflection, and had a slot that accommodated the removable leg structure connecting the panels. \\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-7.jpg)\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-8.jpg)\\n\\nThe leg structures were placed at the intersection of three panels and had three pieces of steel box section fitted within the aluminum U channels and welded at 120 degree increments to form a three-directional cross. \\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-2.jpg)\\n\\n\\n\\nA hole was left at the intersection, into which a threaded tube was welded. An internal hex bolt or long grub screw with a foot plate on the bottom was threaded into the tube and could be adjusted from above through a small hole in the stage using an allen key bit on an impact driver. This arrangement allowed for a push-fit assembly process that was fast, and the legs were extended until they touched the ground to level the stage. \\n\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-6.jpg)\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-1.jpg)\\n\\nThe pieces were held together with inner steel box section curved on the outer curved edge and a large ratchet strap was used to wrap around the entire structure and compress the circle inward, pulling all the pieces together.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/stage-10.jpg)"},{"id":"house-price-paid-parish","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/house-price-paid-parish","editUrl":"https://github.com/reubenliengaard/blog/2021-07-04-house-prices-paid-by-parish.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-04-house-prices-paid-by-parish.md","title":"House prices paid by parish","description":"We used property sale data from the land registry and postal code data from the Ordnance Survey to determine the latitude and longitude coordinates of each house sale.

While we had a site plan and list of locations that needed connectivity, the physical network structure had to be adapted to the site during construction. We had to navigate around obstacles such as roads and areas of the arena that were accessible to the public. Each main cabinet and sub-cabinet needed its own power supply, which we had to coordinate with the electricians on the fly. Sometimes, if they had been to a location before us, we could locate our cabinets near their distribution boxes by following their cables. Other times, they would move the distribution boxes or we would arrive first and they would provide us with one.\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](/img/iow.png)\\n\\nAt least one cherry picker, equipped with a pan-tilt-zoom CCTV camera, was stationed within each arena. CCTV cameras were also installed on scaffolding poles, gateway arches, and stage sides. All bars needed connectivity for their payment terminals. WiFi was provided in the crew and camping areas, and temporary offices were equipped with temporary WiFi and VoIP phones for both internal and external communication. This was necessary because the cellular network often becomes overloaded with the high number of people at events.\\n\\nWe utilized QGIS\'s \'Align Raster\' tool to georeference a high-definition image of the site map. We then uploaded this map to Mapbox and created a basic Leaflet.js web map that used the host phone\'s geolocation to position a marker on the map. This helped us determine our exact location on the map, as physical landmarks were not always visible since the site was under construction. The map helped us identify which tents required connectivity and aided us in orienting ourselves with the site as we walked around.\\n\\nWe used the \'Map Marker\' app on Android to quickly locate network devices as we deployed them. The devices were categorized as AP (access point), SW (switch), RT (router), PTZ (CCTV), VoIP (phone), PTP (point-to-point wireless), and cable types of CAT5 and Fibre. Since the staff members who investigate faults or retrieve hardware after an event are often different from those who deployed it, it can be difficult to locate the devices. A detailed and up-to-date map that shows the locations and connections of all the devices helps to quickly trace faults in the network, which often requires physically searching through tents to find cables.\\n\\nWhen the event was finished, the map was used to quickly locate and retrieve all the equipment."},{"id":"womad","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/womad","editUrl":"https://github.com/reubenliengaard/blog/2019-05-10-womad-live-network-status-map.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-10-womad-live-network-status-map.md","title":"Live network status map for WOMAD 2020","description":"","date":"2019-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 10, 2019","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":0,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Reuben Liengaard","title":"Maintainer","url":"https://reubenliengaard.github.io","key":"reubenliengaard"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"womad","title":"Live network status map for WOMAD 2020","authors":"reubenliengaard","tags":["hello","docusaurus"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Isle of Wight Festival Asset Tracking Network Hardware","permalink":"/blog/isle-of-wight"},"nextItem":{"title":"Identify areas of flat terrain which receive the most sun","permalink":"/blog/flat-sunny"}},"content":""},{"id":"flat-sunny","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/flat-sunny","editUrl":"https://github.com/reubenliengaard/blog/2019-05-09-flat-sunny-spots.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-09-flat-sunny-spots.md","title":"Identify areas of flat terrain which receive the most sun","description":"We imported lidar data into GDAL Grass and used sun shade and slope tools to identify flat areas with above average annual sunlight exposure.","date":"2019-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 9, 2019","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":0.12,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Reuben Liengaard","title":"Maintainer","url":"https://reubenliengaard.github.io","key":"reubenliengaard"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"flat-sunny","title":"Identify areas of flat terrain which receive the most sun","authors":"reubenliengaard","tags":["hello","docusaurus"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Live network status map for WOMAD 2020","permalink":"/blog/womad"},"nextItem":{"title":"Bath Festival - Ruckus wireless heatmap","permalink":"/blog/bath-festival"}},"content":"We imported lidar data into GDAL Grass and used sun shade and slope tools to identify flat areas with above average annual sunlight exposure."},{"id":"bath-festival","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/bath-festival","editUrl":"https://github.com/reubenliengaard/blog/2018-04-08-bath-festival-ruckus-wireless-heatmap .md","source":"@site/blog/2018-04-08-bath-festival-ruckus-wireless-heatmap .md","title":"Bath Festival - Ruckus wireless heatmap","description":"A small deployment of access points was placed around the tents at the Bath Festival.

This data was then uploaded into ArcGIS, where a tool was used to create a heat map, which was overlayed over the site plan."},{"id":"aonb-permitted-development","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/aonb-permitted-development","editUrl":"https://github.com/reubenliengaard/blog/2018-04-01-aonb-permitted-development.md","source":"@site/blog/2018-04-01-aonb-permitted-development.md","title":"AONB Permitted Development","description":"We imported topographic polygons from the OS MasterMap into GIS software, and used the buffer tool to create lines to identify what we could build where.
