# About
My name is Reuben Liengaard and I am an experienced designer with a strong background in applied technology. My passion is using computation to solve complex problems, and I have expertise in a range of fields including Linux, networking, environmental monitoring, geospatial analysis, parametric modeling, and artificial intelligence.

My goal is to use clean code to process large quantities of data, simplifying complexity and making the world a smarter, more sustainable place. I am always on the lookout for innovative ways to make a positive impact, and I believe that by combining the worlds of nature and technology, we can find creative solutions to a variety of challenges. For example, we can use infra-red satellite imagery to identify heat loss in buildings or data querying to locate, protect, or re-instate wildlife corridors.

In my professional career, I have worked in a number of fields including architecture and network engineering. I gained valuable experience during an internship at Heatherwick Studio, a renowned firm known for its creative and award-winning designs. I also held a position as a network field engineer at Etherlive, a company that provides temporary broadband services for events.

Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you find my work inspiring and interesting.
