# About


I will briefly document the development of some of my architectural interests and exploits so far.  The legacy of my great grandfather Ove Arup has had a profound influence over me. Inspired by what I saw in the Arup Journal, I developed a love for the characteristics of thin shell structures and built hundreds of woven frames from hazel. The materials limited rigidity led me to developed a torus shaped design. Later this fascination with form drew me to study traditional wooden boat building.  
I wanted to build a home on a patch of land in the garden. I drafted numerous designs, drawing inspiration from the book Shelter by Lloyd Khann. With friends I began mining stone in my garden. Eventually we had created a 14-meter long tunnel into the hill complete with wooden pit props. Later we would re-enforce the tunnel with concrete.
At school in a lesson on the history of architecture, my teacher had emphasised the importance of a thorough understanding of materials. After my graduation I attended a year long course in fine joinery followed by a two year apprenticeship in stone masonry. I also recently attended a course in steel fabrication. A growing interest in aquaponics led me to extensive research into domestic food production. I discovered a wealth of information on the Food and Agriculture Organisation website as well as drawing inspiration from projects undertaken by the New Alchemy Institute in the field ecological system engineering. My uncle introduced me to Spirulina, a micro algae he had encountered being cultivated in Africa. It apparently contained a perfect nutritional balance to sustain human life, with an unrivaled growth rate. I began researching ways in which photo bioreactors could be integrated into buildings.When our pottery shed needed re-building, I made a model using SketchUp that detailed each stage of the construction. Along with two friends I proceeded to build an eight meter square, twin story oak framed building set into the hillside over the course of a year. Through my interest in boats I became involved with a Canadian theatre company. I worked repairing their ship and helping with the production of their latest show. I created a CAD drawing with a scene for each stage of the rigging procedure. I was invited to join them for a month on their tour as an aerial rigger for their giant spider puppets. I created a studio for myself, as I wanted to explore building technologies and create a visual typology of structural elements. I discovered a collection of color-coded material selection charts that I could use for subsequent drawings. I wanted to make physical models of each kind of structure and was drawn to research form finding software, computational geometry, physical form finding using saturated cloth models and fabric formed plaster. Recently I have begun creatively combining technologies, leading me to research conductive heat transfer between the cooling graph of a body of water and an annual outside temperature graph, and how wall conductivity and mass effects this. I have conducted research into vacuums and vacuum-insulated solar hot water systems, the power of large lenses for concentrating solar energy and the possibility of reducing the cost of optical technology by replacing glass with water or mineral oil. I have been content working as a part time stonemason whilst I explore ideas for buildings, yet I feel it necessary to broaden my understanding with the depth of knowledge only available through a university education. I wanted to investigate the functional technologies of buildings as a foundation before I proceeded to explore sociological or aesthetic considerations.  I hope a course of study will slowly fill in the gaps between my interests as they homogenise, evolve and solidify into the form of my future practice. I very much look forward to bouncing ideas off tutors and peers as we work together to develop increasingly resilient architecture. 




Etherlive is a company that specializes in providing temporary broadband services to event sites. We have the experience and supplier relationships necessary to arrange the required connectivity for your event. Our process involves working with the event organizers to determine the type and amount of internet needed before placing orders or exploring provision options for the site. Our engineering teams are proficient in a variety of technologies and can deliver the best event connectivity to meet the needs of the event. For larger events, we offer options for providing high-speed connectivity over copper phone lines with speeds of up to 40mbps. Dedicated, high-speed connectivity can also be installed without the lead time of fibre optics in cases where fibre may be impractical due to cost or installation time. We also offer bonding with technologies such as satellite, 4G, FTTC, and leased lines. For events in remote locations, we have multiple points of presence throughout the UK that can be linked wirelessly to provide high-speed connectivity. In built-up areas requiring quick setup, cellular technology may be a suitable option. We use systems like private APN technology to ensure event customers can continue operating smoothly. For events held at the same site for multiple years or those with very high-speed requirements, fibre connectivity may be the best option. Our team of experienced engineers, installation teams, and suppliers can provide fibre connectivity for broadcast or internet purposes, with speeds ranging from 5mbps to gigabytes. We also keep a stock of high-speed satellite units on hand for quick deployment in remote locations and can provide either static or fully mobile systems.

could you describe in the first person how i did an internship for a company with a description as follows; " Heatherwick Studio is a team of over 200 problem solvers dedicated to making the physical world around us better for everyone. Based out of our combined workshop and design studio in Central London, we create buildings, spaces, master-plans, objects and infrastructure. Focusing on large scale projects in cities all over the world, we prioritise those with the greatest positive social impact. Working as practical inventors with no signature style, our motivation is to design soulful and interesting places which embrace and celebrate the complexities of the real world. The approach driving everything is to lead from human experience rather than any fixed design dogma. The studio’s founder Thomas Heatherwick comes from a background immersed in materials and making. His curiosity and passion for problem-solving matured into the studio’s current design process where every architect, designer, landscape architect and maker is encouraged to challenge and contribute ideas. Positive and pragmatic, the studio’s team are collaborators whose role is to listen, question, then lead the conception and construction of special and unusual places. Ingenuity and inspiration are used to make projects that are affordable, buildable and sustainable. And our client is vital, who comes on the journey and challenges our thinking; together we look for the opportunities that might traditionally be overlooked. Our best future projects are the ones that will teach us the most. Heatherwick Studio has won more than 100 international awards for design excellence, including the Prix Versailles and the RIBA National Awards. Some of the most recent include.  "



I have a strong interest in architecture. I have a love for thin shell structures and have built numerous woven frames out of hazel. My fascination with form has also led me to study traditional wooden boat building. I have also been interested in building technologies and have created a studio to explore this further. ive been pursuing my interests and am now looking to further my education and understanding of functional technologies
