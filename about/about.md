# About

I have always been interested in architecture and have pursued a number of projects and experiences that have helped me develop my skills and knowledge in this field.

One of my early interests was in thin shell structures, which I developed by building hundreds of woven frames from hazel. This led me to create a torus-shaped design and eventually to study traditional wooden boat building.

I also had a strong desire to build a home on a piece of land in my garden, which led me to draft numerous designs and seek inspiration from the book Shelter by Lloyd Khann. Along with friends, I even mined stone in my garden and eventually built a 14-meter long tunnel reinforced with concrete.

To further my understanding of materials, I attended a year-long course in fine joinery and a two-year apprenticeship in stone masonry. I also recently took a course in steel fabrication.

My interests also led me to research aquaponics, domestic food production, and the use of photo bioreactors in buildings. I even became involved with a Canadian theater company, where I worked as an aerial rigger for giant spider puppets.

Currently, I am working part-time as a stonemason while I continue to explore ideas for buildings and technologies, including conductive heat transfer, vacuum-insulated solar hot water systems, and the use of large lenses for concentrating solar energy.

I believe that a university education would provide me with the depth of knowledge and opportunities to collaborate with others that I need to continue to grow and evolve in my practice as an architect. I am excited to work with tutors and peers to develop increasingly resilient architecture.
