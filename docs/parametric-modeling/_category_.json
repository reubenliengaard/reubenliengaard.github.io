    "description": "Parametric modeling is the process of using mathematical models that are based on a set of parameters to represent and analyze data. Parametric modeling is important because it allows us to make predictions and draw conclusions about the data, and to understand the relationships between different variables. It is often used in fields such as engineering, finance, and science to analyze and understand complex systems and processes."
