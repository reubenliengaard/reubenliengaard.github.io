    "description": "Environmental monitoring is another important application of AI and related technologies. By using sensors to collect data on various environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality, developers can use MQTT and InfluxDB to transmit and store this data for analysis. This data can then be used to develop more accurate and effective environmental models, as well as to identify and address any potential issues."
