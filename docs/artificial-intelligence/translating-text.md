# Generating text with OpenAI
To obtain a workshop manual in your desired language for your van, follow these steps:

Search for a workshop manual in the desired language (in this case, British English).

If you are unable to find a manual in the desired language, you can try using optical character recognition to extract the text from the PDF and then feeding it through a neural network translation service to obtain a version in your desired language.

To do this, you will need to split the PDF file into smaller files and feed each one through the translation service.

Once you have completed the translation process, you will have a beautifully illustrated PDF in your desired language that describes how to carry out any work you might want to do on your van.

This information may be useful to others, so you may consider sharing it with them.
