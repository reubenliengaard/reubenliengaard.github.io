## Introduction

### What?

Using Podman Play Kube

> podman kube play will read in a structured file of Kubernetes YAML. It will then recreate the containers, pods or volumes described in the YAML. Containers within a pod are then started and the ID of the new Pod or the name of the new Volume is output. If the yaml file is specified as “-” then podman kube play will read the YAML file from stdin. Using the --down command line option, it is also capable of tearing down the pods created by a previous run of podman kube play. Using the --replace command line option, it will tear down the pods(if any) created by a previous run of podman kube play and recreate the pods with the Kubernetes YAML file. Ideally the input file would be one created by Podman (see podman-kube-generate(1)). This would guarantee a smooth import and expected results. The input can also be a URL that points to a YAML file such as https://podman.io/demo.yml. podman kube play will read the YAML from the URL and create pods and containers from it.
